# online_shopping_system

This Java program simulates a basic online shopping system with the following key features:

1. **User Login/Logout**: Users can log in with predefined credentials (`username: sharath`, `password: 1234`). Logged-in users can access additional features like adding items to the cart and checking out.

2. **Browse Products**: Users can view a list of available products, each with a unique ID, name, and price.

3. **Add to Cart**: Logged-in users can add products to their shopping cart by entering the product ID.

4. **View Cart**: Displays the items currently in the cart and the total cost.

5. **Checkout**: Allows logged-in users to finalize their purchase, which clears the cart.

6. **Exit**: Ends the program.

The program's flow involves menu-based interaction, allowing users to navigate through login, product browsing, cart management, and checkout.
